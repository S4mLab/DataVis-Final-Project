        Waste is defined as any object or material that is deemed unusable after
        its main use. We encounter waste products on a daily basis, such as food
        scraps, packaging from boxes, finished products or even a car that has
        run its due course. While it is unattainable in nature to lead a
        lifestyle where no individuals produce waste, the mass consumption of
        materials lead to an increasing sum of waste generated every day. This
        website aims to show the size of waste generated in our environment
        globally and look into the waste generation in Australia, which will
        bring insight into how this waste could affect the environment
        surrounding us.

        According to (Plaine Products 2021), plastic was discovered in the 1800s
        and became widely popular after the Second World War in the 1960s and
        1970s where its demand rose due to versatility, inexpensiveness and
        sanitary nature. Although beneficial, the production of plastic
        increased drastically and is visible in the graph below, which shows the
        global production of plastic from 1950 to 2014.

        With the increased production in plastic, it also creates a lasting
        negative impact on our environment which is already evident such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Plastic debris that end up in the ocean due to littering will be
            consumed by marine creatures and poison them since plastic is not
            biodegradable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Plastic in landfills can introduce harmful chemicals into the
            groundwater which can contaminate water systems
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The destruction of plastic by combustion leads to the release of
            toxic chemicals such as hydrochloric acid , sulphur dioxide and
            heavy metals, according to (Biemiller 2013)

        From the graph above, it is clear how large the plastic contribution is
        to the environment. To some individuals, they may assume that such a
        large plastic consumption maybe due to that 8 million individuals live
        in the world and if observed on a personal level, it may not be as large
        in consumption. But how much waste does one individual usually produce
        in a year?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="para5" class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        The answer to this exact question is visible in the graph below, where
        it presents the plastic contributions of 365 randomly selected
        individuals on a global scale and their total yearly plastic
        consumption. This graph also allows you to observe the different types
        of plastic contributions an individual can make in their household, by
        simply selecting the type of plastic on the drop-down list below.

        Let’s now focus on the size of waste in Australia; Australia is a
        continent hosting over 25 million individuals, all of whom inevitably
        produce waste and contribute to the waste acquisition in the
        environment. Australia generated approximately 76 million tonnes of
        waste in the period of 2018-2019 according to (Australian Bureau of
        Statistics 2020). With such high volumes of waste produced within a
        year, Australia manages their waste by exporting it to other countries
        such as Indonesia and India. The graph below shows the amount of waste
        produced in Australia that are exported to other countries in the period
        of 2018 to 2019, based on the type of waste.

      <p>
        According to (Moran 2020), the large exports made to countries such as
        Indonesia by Australia lead to waste dumped into Brantas River in
        Indonesia or burnt, both of which created a large impact on those
        residing in Indonesia as it affected the countries water supply and
        pollution in air. These impacts are unfortunately the fate for other
        countries that receive waste for management and the sheer size of waste
        exported by Australia solely provides evidence to it.

        From the graphs and information above, we hope that you gained insight
        on how significantly large the sum of waste generated is and how it can
        impact our environment and lifestyle. There are a multitude of methods
        to reduce waste production, which could lead to a sustainable future. A
        sustainable future would mean that the chances of unnecessary waste
        production would be lowered, thus will preserve resources for the future
        generations to make use of and lead an environmentally-conscious life.
